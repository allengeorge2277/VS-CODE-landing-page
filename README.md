## VS-Code-landing-page

This is a simple website created using HTML and CSS as part of my journey into front-end web development. 
The project serves as a foundation for learning and experimenting with web design and development concepts.

This project was created to:
- Practice the basics of HTML and CSS.
- Understand the structure and styling of web pages.

Planned improvements to the project by:
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript.
- Integrating modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
